This directory contains resources some scripts need, like onset times, ROI masks,
and reference volumes.

The most important file here is study_info.par. This file should be filled out first
when starting a new project. It contains all basic 
parameters for your study, and is used to initialize globals.par and par_import.json
when you first set up the pipeline.
